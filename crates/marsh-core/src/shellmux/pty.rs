//! Pseudoterminals, and the suspend character a job's terminal does not have.
//!
//! A job runs attached to its own pseudoterminal: the shell owns the master, the traced child gets
//! the slave as its standard descriptors and controlling terminal. Two things about that terminal
//! are not what a default `openpty` would give, and both are load-bearing:
//!
//! * The descriptors are opened with `O_CLOEXEC` atomically, so a concurrent `fork`/`exec`
//!   elsewhere in the process cannot leak a job's terminal into an unrelated child.
//! * The suspend character is disabled, so Ctrl-Z reaches the job as an ordinary byte instead of
//!   becoming a `SIGTSTP` that no child disposition can take back.
//!
//! [`SuspendKeyGuard`] does the same to the *console's* terminal for the length of a session, and
//! puts back exactly the one character it took — never a whole snapshot, which would silently
//! revert everything else the session changed meanwhile.
